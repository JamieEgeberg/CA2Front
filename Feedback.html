            <h1>Feedback - Flow 2</h1>
            <p>Flow 2 was at times a bit chaotic, probably as an effect of having two different teachers with very different teaching styles. 
			Lessons could have been streamlined a bit, so the duration of different lessons didn't vary as much.
			<br/>
			In general it seemed like a bit of communication between the teachers was lacking, and one wasn't sure what the other had told us.
			At other times it seemed like we missed an important connection between two subjects when swithching between teachers.
			<br/> 
			In SP5, it was frustrating that later exercises were based on having finished the previous assignments. 
			If one had trouble getting the previous to work, you were just stuck until Friday, where you could ask for help.
